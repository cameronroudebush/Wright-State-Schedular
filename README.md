# Wright-State-Scheduler
Welcome to WSS! This program was built with one goal in mind: to make it so you don't have to wake up at 7am to schedule classes! Let's be honest nobody likes waking up **SUPER** early just to schedule some classes. Well here is your solution! This software gives you the option to not only plugin CRN's to schedule now but even in the future at whatever given time you want! Just look at the UI below!

WSS can do all the following:

-  Schedule at this exact moment
-  Schedule at any given time in the future
-  Enter up to 8 CRN's at a time
-  Select any semester that is offered (Spring, Summer, Fall)
-  Alert you if your UID or password is incorrect
-  Make sure you only put in time values for the future
-  Keep logs of any potential failures
-  Alert you if the given CRN's have a registration or co-requisite error


If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact roudebushcameron@gmail.com.
